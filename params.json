The first piece is written in Python and deals with core \r\nfunctionality, like reading and logging temperature. The second part is a web interface written in PHP and deals \r\nprimarily with the user interface and management of the system.\r\n\r\nIf you have any improvements at all please go ahead and make them, then submit a pull request!\r\nIf you can't do that, at least [let us know](https://github.com/davegreen/PiCH/tree/master#contact) what you would like to see.\r\n\r\n### Core functionality (Python)\r\n\r\n- Reads data from the temperature sensors.\r\n- Writes information about the sensors and temperature to a MySQL database.\r\n- Manages the heating system, turning the boiler on and off to keep to the target temperature.\r\n- Displays the temp (in degrees centigrade) to one decimal place on 3 7-segment LED displays (e.g. 19.8)\r\n\r\n### Web interface\r\n\r\n- Display current and historical temperature data in the web interface.\r\n- Allow management and naming of the temperature sensors plugged in.\r\n- Scheduling and rule creation for heating system control.\r\n- Easy management of other system settings and features.\r\n\r\n![PiCH temperature logging page](http://tookitaway.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/templog.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n---------------------\r\nSee the wiki page: https://github.com/davegreen/PiCH/wiki/TODO\r\n\r\nSetting Up\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nContact\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n---------------------\r\n- [RaspberryPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) - For making it possible.\r\n- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) - For making things look good.\r\n- [WiringPi](https://github.com/WiringPi) - For making it easy to use the GPIO pins.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
